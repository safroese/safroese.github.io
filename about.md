## 🧠 About Me

My professional journey began in clinical health psychology, where I earned BA, MS, and PhD degrees and worked in medical and healthcare settings. In the 2010s, I transitioned into the IT field, earning a BS in Cybersecurity and Network Administration. I began in helpdesk support at a mental health agency, then served as an Application Analyst for a major hospital system’s electronic health record (EHR). I returned to the mental health agency and advanced to my current role as Database Administrator, which I’ve held since January 2022.
